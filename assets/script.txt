Hello voyager! I see that you have come to visit our famed city of Atlantis.
Hmm? What am I? I am NOVA... an orb.
Anyway we are in dire straits! You need to save Atlantis!
On-landers have polluted the oceans so much Atlantis may just be buried and forever lost...
Did you know that every year, billions of pounds of trash and other pollutants enter the ocean?
80% of marine pollution comes from on-landers!
But now that you are here to help I'm a lot more reassured!
First thing I want you to help is with all the oil oozing into our ocean.
Now, there are two types of oil pollution, non point source and point source.
Point source pollution occurs from a source that can be identified, like an oil spill.
However, non point source pollution occurs due to runoff, and end up in our oceans via our roads, rivers and drainpipes.
Point source pollution such as oil spills only account for about 12% of our ocean's oil pollution.
On the other hand, non point source pollution accounts for three times as much!
