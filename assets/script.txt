Hello Voyager! I see that you have come to visit our famed city of Atlantis.
Hmm? What am I? I am NOVA... an orb.
(The Nanotechnological Oxygen Vital Accelerator responsible for the oxygen dome that surrounds Atlantis)
Anyway we are in dire straits! You need to save Atlantis!
The oceans are polluted to the point Atlantis may just be buried and forever lost...
But now that you are here to help I'm a lot more reassured.
Because there has been a massive oil spill, we currently cannot defend against all the pollutants headed our way.
Defend Atlantis by destroying as much of that junk as possible!
You will be equipped with a laser gun [SPACE TO FIRE] that destroys any trash on impact, but it won't work on oil.
To blast away oil, you will need to utilize special laser missiles [CLICK TO FIRE], obtained from missile crates.
To get a speed boost, [HOLD SHIFT].
To heal, pick up dropping hearts.
Demolishing trash gives +1 points
Disintegrating oil grants +10 points
Let's get started!

About all the oil oozing into our ocean...
There are two types of oil pollution, non point source and point source.
Point source pollution occurs from identifiable sources, like an oil spill.
Point source pollution such as oil spills only account for about 12% of our ocean's oil pollution.
On the other hand, non point source pollution accounts for three times as much!
